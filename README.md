# Queueing-Models-in-Cloud-Computing


Queueing models are mathematical representations used to analyze and predict the behavior of systems where customers, tasks, or data units arrive, wait, and are served. This project explores different queueing models and their applications in various scenarios, focusing on performance metrics such as waiting times, queue lengths, and system utilization.

## Overview
This project provides implementations of common queueing models used in operations research, computer science, and engineering. These models can be applied to analyze systems such as:

- Customer service queues
- Network traffic
- Manufacturing systems
- Software processing queues

By simulating these models, we can gain insights into how to optimize resources and improve system performance.

---

## Features
- Implementation of standard queueing models such as M/M/1, M/M/c, and M/G/1.
- Simulation of real-world queueing scenarios.
- Calculation of key performance metrics:
  - Average waiting time
  - Queue length
  - System utilization
- Visualization of results for better understanding.

## Queueing Models
The following models are implemented in this project:

1. **M/M/1**: Single-server queue with exponential inter-arrival and service times.
2. **M/M/c**: Multi-server queue with exponential inter-arrival and service times.
3. **M/G/1**: Single-server queue with exponential inter-arrival and general service times.
